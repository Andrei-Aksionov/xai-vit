## How to use it

1. Install all the required packages. In this project all the python dependencies are managed by [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and are stored in "pyproject.toml" file (in this file also specified required version of python). After `poetry` is installed and virtual environment is created (in case you don't want poetry to create it [automatically](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvscreate)), run:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
